<CENTER><h1>Image Sharpening with a Laplacian Kernel</h1></CENTER>

<p> <b>QUESTION:</B> I'd like to see more fine detail in my image. Someone told
me of a technique called "image sharpening" that may be the answer to my prayers.
They say I need to use a Laplacian operator. What in the world is that? And is there
any chance I can do this in IDL?</P>

<p><B> ANSWER:</B> Your friend has probably been reading the excellent book, 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201180758/coysguitoidlp">
<em>Digital Image Processing, Second Edition</EM></A> by Gonzales and Woods. It is a
book well worth picking up if you plan to do any image processing in IDL. And, yes, 
you can do this kind of thing in IDL. Let me show you how.</P>

<p>Image sharpening falls into a category of image processing called <em>spacial filtering</em>.
One can take advantage of how quickly or abruptly gray-scale values or colors change from one
pixel to the next. First order operators (using first derivative measurements) are particularly
good at finding edges in images. The <b>Sobel</b> and <b>Roberts</b> edge enhancement operators in IDL 
are examples of these first order filters, sometimes called <em>gradient filters</em>. </P>

<p>The Laplacian operator is an example of a second order or second derivative method of
enhancement. It is particularly good at finding the fine detail in an image. Any feature
with a sharp discontinuity (like noise, unfortunately) will be enhanced by a Laplacian operator.
Thus, one application of a Laplacian operator is to restore fine detail to an image which has
been smoothed to remove noise. (The median operator is often used to remove noise in an image.)</P>

<p>Consider the original 2D byte value image below, which is provided courtesy of NASA. This view of the 
Moon's north pole is a mosaic assembled from 18 images
taken by Galileo's imaging system as the 
spacecraft flew by on December 7, 1992.
The same image is found on page 130 of Gonzalez and Woods.</P>

<!-- ************** GRAPHIC EXAMPLE ************-->

<P><A HREF="sharpen_1.jpg"><IMG SRC="sharpen_1.jpg" 
ALT="The original moon image."></A>

<p>The Laplacian operator is implemented in IDL as a convolution between
an image and a kernel. The <b>Convol</b> function is used to perform the
convolution. The Laplacian kernel can be constructed in various ways, but
we will use the same 3-by-3 kernel used by Gonzalez and Woods, and shown
in the figure below.</P>

<P><A HREF="sharpen_2.jpg"><IMG SRC="sharpen_2.jpg" 
ALT="The Laplacian kernel."></A>

<p>In image convolution, the kernel is centered on each pixel in turn, and the
pixel value is replaced by the sum of the kernel mutipled by the image values.
In the particular kernel we are using here, we are counting the contributions
of the diagonal pixels as well as the orthogonal pixels in the filter operation.
This is not always necessary or desirable, although it works well here.</P>

<p> The Laplacian kernel is constructed in IDL like this:</P>

<PRE>
   IDL> kernel = Replicate(-1, 3, 3)
   IDL> kernel[1,1] = 8
   IDL> Print, kernel
       -1       -1       -1
       -1        8       -1
       -1       -1       -1
</PRE>

<p>We apply the convolution kernel to the image and display the filtered image
like this:</P>

<PRE>
   IDL> filtered = Convol(image, kernel, Center=1)
   IDL> TV, filtered
</PRE>

<p> The results are shown in the figure below.</P>

<P><A HREF="sharpen_3.jpg"><IMG SRC="sharpen_3.jpg" 
ALT="The image filtered with the Laplacian kernel."></A></P>

<P>Note the amount of fine detail found in the image with this filter.
What we want to do is add this information back into the original image
in order to sharpen the image. To do this properly, we have to scale
the filtered data into the same 0 to 255 values of the original image.</P>

<P>It took me a while to understand this step in Gonzales and Woods.
Part of the problem is that the <b>Convol</b> function retains the
same data type as the original image. But a true convolution with
this kernal can result in negative image values. We are discarding
such values when we displayed the filtered image, above. The proper
way to do the convolution is to make both the filter and the image
integer values. Then the filter can be scaled by subtracting the
minimum value of the filter from the results, and then multiplying
by 255 and dividing by the maximum value of the filter after the
minimum value has been added to it. The code looks like this.</P>

<PRE>
   IDL> filtered = Convol(Fix(image), kernel, Center=1)
   IDL> filtered = filtered - Min(filtered)
   IDL> filtered = filtered * (255.0/Max(filtered))
   IDL> TV, filtered
</PRE>

<p>Note the use of "255.0" in the expression above. If I used a "255"
I would be doing integer division and the result would undoubtably be
a zero, not what I expect. One side effect of this is that the filtered
image is now a floating point array, even though it is scaled in the range
of 0 to 255. (The <b>TV</b> command converts the floating point array to byte values
before it is displayed.) </P>

<p>You see the scaled filter results in the figure below.</P>

<P><A HREF="sharpen_4.jpg"><IMG SRC="sharpen_4.jpg" 
ALT="The image filtered with the Laplacian kernel and scaled."></A></P>

<p>Now, to complete the image sharpening I have to add the filtered
Laplacian image back to the original image, and scale the data
into the range 0 to 255. Here is the code.</P>

<PRE>
   IDL> sharpened = image + filtered
   IDL> sharpened = sharpened - Min(sharpened )
   IDL> sharpened = sharpened * (255.0/Max(sharpened ))
   IDL> TV, sharpened 
</PRE>

<p>The sharpened image is shown below. Note the presence of more
fine detail in the image.</P>

<P><A HREF="sharpen_5.jpg"><IMG SRC="sharpen_5.jpg" 
ALT="The Laplacian sharpened image."></A></P>

<p>The sharpened image is quite a bit lighter than the same image
shown in Gonzales and Woods. But I think this is because the image
doesn't have the same dynamic gray-scale range as the original image.
A quick histogram stretch (done with <A HREF="../programs/cgstretch.pro"> cgStretch</A>)
quickly puts things right. By stretching the image between the values 60 and 200,
we come up with the final image, shown below beside the original image.</P>

<PRE>
   IDL> TV, BytScl(sharpened, Min=60, Max=200)
</PRE>

<P><A HREF="sharpen_1.jpg"><IMG SRC="sharpen_1.jpg" 
ALT="The original moon image."></A>
<A HREF="sharpen_6.jpg"><IMG SRC="sharpen_6.jpg" 
ALT="The final Laplacian sharpened image stretched to a different dynamic gray-scale range."></A></P>

<P> If you would like to try Laplacian sharpening with your own image, you
can use the <A HREF="../programs/sharpen.pro">
Sharpen</a> program. Rather than stretching the image as above, the 
<B>Sharpen </B>program matches the histogram of the sharpened image to 
the histogram of the original image with the <A HREF="../programs/histomatch.pro">
Histomatch</a> program. You would use it like this to obtain a sharpened image.</P>

<PRE>
   IDL> sharpenedImage = Sharpen(image)
</PRE>

<P>If you would like to see the intermediate steps, set the <b>Display</b> keyword.</P>

<PRE>
   IDL> sharpenedImage = Sharpen(image, /Display)
</PRE>
